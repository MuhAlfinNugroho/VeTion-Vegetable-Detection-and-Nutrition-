# Mobile Development
### We will develop modern and visually appealing apps using Kotlin programming and integrating the Jetpack Compose, Room, Retrofit2, CameraX, and Material Design. We implement a clean code architecture, connect applications to the API, and apply third-party services. Our application design follows the features designed based on existing problems and user needs using Figma.

### Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- Architecture MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model) Repository Pattern
- Retrofit2 & OkHttp3: Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- Glide: Loading images from network.
- TensorFlow Lite: TensorFlow Lite is an open source deep learning framework for on-device inference.
- Jetpact Compose : Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit developed by Google for building user interfaces (UI) in Android applications.
- CameraX : CameraX is a Jetpack library, built to ease the development of camera apps.
- Material Design : Material Design is to provide consistent and intuitive design guidelines for application development.
- Coroutines : Coroutine is a concurrent design pattern that you can use in Android to simplify asynchronously executed code.
- Shared preferences : Shared Preferences are used in Android app development to store data persistently on the device.
