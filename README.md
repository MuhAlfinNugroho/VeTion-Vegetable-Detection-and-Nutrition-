# Mobile Development
### We will develop modern and visually appealing apps using Kotlin programming and integrating the Jetpack Compose, Room, Retrofit2, CameraX, and Material Design. We implement a clean code architecture, connect applications to the API, and apply third-party services. Our application design follows the features designed based on existing problems and user needs using Figma.
